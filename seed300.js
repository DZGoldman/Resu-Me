'  implemented an automated sliding window table partition on large fact tables in the enterprise data warehouse. load time of partitioned fact tables went from two hours to five minutes in the nightly batch load process from lps. the extensible framework greatly reduced implementation time of future fact tables and large structures. brought all mission critical production sql instances under version control to perforce. this clearly defined an audit trail that identified individual ddl and dml alterations within an rfc. developed a custom application that leveraged red gate sql compare and perforce apis to automate routine ddl and dml modifications to databases under source. additional redundancy was realized as this software created snapshots of database schema, which in turn could then be restored in case of failure caused by new changes. designed and deployed disk layouts for all databases during the migration to a hitachi vsp storage array. the migration process was executed with no impact to existing environments. new disk configurations eliminated i/o bottlenecks and improved adoption of the companys systems. optimized and tuned oltp and olap instances. identified malformed queries, bottlenecks and non-performing or missing indices using pssdiag, profiler, spotlight and perfmon. these optimizations increased the roi on current infrastructure and avoided unnecessary capital expenditures. participated in bcp planning and annual dr testing. lead team members during testing to ensure 100% of day zero and day one instances recovered at the hot site in glen allen, va. provided leadership to three other team members as a senior administrator. responsible for delegating daily and project work loads to other peers. trained and developed new hires allowing them to fully integrate as productive team members. created and employed company wide database guidelines and standards. partook in regular architectural and design review sessions to ensure new applications adhered to these standards. installed a central management server to administer all sql instances. utilized cms to apply policy-based management and run multi-server queries for all environments.
